Andrew Conte
I am a second-degree student majoring in Multimedia Computing with my first degree being in Television and Radio production. However, I am considering pivoting to a CS degree as I have become more and more interested in artificial intelligence over the past few months and would like to work in that field. My hobbies include playing strategy games like chess, Hearthstone, and Civilization, as well as going to the gym and listening to music.
